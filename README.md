# kNN-perceptron-from-scratch
The Jupyter notebook consists of 2 parts:
- Creating a dataset consisting of 40 pictures of dogs and tests and applying a kNN classifier to classify at least 5 images (different from the 40 images). The algorithm is applied by varying k from 1 to 20, to determine the best suited k.
- Building a perceptron to classify the same set of images. Training is started with similar similar weights to both the features, and then trained with the 40 samples to build the classifier. The classifier is applied on 5 different test images.

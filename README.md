# kNN-from-scratch
The assignment consists of 2 parts:
1. Collect at least 20 images of two categories: cats and dogs from the internet. Determine any two features. Apply kNN classifier to classify at least 5 images (different from the 40 images). Apply your algorithm by varying k from 1 to 20, and see the best suited k.
2. For the same set of images and same features, build a perceptron to classify the images. Start the training with similar weights to both the features, and then train with the 40 samples to build the classifier. Apply the classifier on 5 images.
